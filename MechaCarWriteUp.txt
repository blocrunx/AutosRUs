Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Summary 1: 

Excluding the intercept p-value which tests the hypothesis that the intercept is 0,  vehicle.length, and ground.clearance are below the 0.05 threshold of our null hypothesis which indicates a non-random amount of variance. Therefore, vehicle.length and ground.clearance have been selected as the coefficients to use in the multiple linear regression.
   
Question 2:

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Summary 2:

This model shows slope estimates of 6.08 and 3.57. Additionally, the p value represents the hypothesis test that the slope is zero. With a p-value well below 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected, statistically supporting the conclusion that the slope is not considered to be zero. 

Question 3:

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Summary 3:

The model effectively predicts a trend in the data, however, with the coefficient of multiple determination value only being 0.67, it falls short of predicting the variability of mpg for MechaCar prototypes with a high degree of accuracy. This is likely because there are additional factors that contribute to a vehicles fuel efficiency that are not present in this dataset. It would be advisable to conduct future multiple linear regressions with additional data such as a vehicle’s coefficient of aerodynamic drag, or the coefficient of kinetic friction for a vehicle’s tires. 

PART 2 - Suspension Coil Summary

Using the pastect packages’ stat.desc() function on the PSI variable, it was found that the current manufacturing data meets the design specification with a  standard deviation of 7.892, which when squared provides the variance of 62.29, falling within the allowable variance of 100 PSI from the mean. 

PART 3 - Suspension Coil T-Test

The following analysis assumes the data provided in the Suspension_Coil.csv file is the sample data. The t-test returned a t-value of 1.89 and a p-value of 0.06. The p-value is above the pre-defined significance value of 0.05 and therefore fails to reject the null hypothesis. With the null hypothesis rejected it can be concluded that the means are statistically similar. 


PART 4 – Design Your Own Study

When designing a study to understand how customers view the performance of a new product it is crucial to understand the benchmarks that contribute to overall customer satisfaction. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Survey which surveys approximately 300,000 Americans each year, customer satisfaction in the Automobile industry for 2019 is down 3.7% over the previous year. Participants in the survey listed quality, value, and driver experience as the key indicators for the drop in satisfaction(ACSI, 2019, Retrieved from https://www.theacsi.org/industries/manufacturing/automobile).  With this in mind, management has requested assistance in developing a statistical study to compare the performance of the MechaCar prototype with the competitors. 
 
The auto industry’s overall customer satisfaction with dependability (engine, parts, breakdowns) fell 1% in 2019 over 2018 making it the area of focus for MechaCar’s statistical study.  This study will attempt to answer the following questions:

Is there is a correlation between manufacturing cost, and vehicle dependability? 
Is there is a correlation between manufacturing location, and vehicle dependability? 

Test 1 – Null Hypothesis: The means of dependability are statistically similar regardless of manufacturing cost.

To test the null hypothesis, the r-squared and p-values of the regression will be examined. It should be noted, in this regression model the p-value is testing whether the slope of the model is zero. If the study returns a p-value less than the studies significance level of 0.05, it will support the alternative hypothesis that that the model does in fact have a slope, and the means are not statistically similar.  If the significance level is above 0.05, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and it will be concluded that manufacture cost is not statistically significant when determining customers satisfaction with dependability. Additionally, the r-squared value will provide a percentage of how often the model predicts customer satisfaction based on cost of manufacture. If the model has a p-value of 0.05 or less and a r-squared value of 0.49(r-value of 0.7) or greater, it can be concluded that the means of dependability are statistically different and that customer satisfaction based on manufacture cost can be accurately predicted by the linear model.

Test 2 – Null Hypothesis:  The means of dependability are not statistically correlated across manufacturing regions.

To test the null hypothesis, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient will be examined to determine whether vehicle dependability is correlated to the region in which it is manufactured.  For the purposes of this study, if the correlation coefficient or r-value is 0.7 or greater, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the alternative hypothesis that there is a strong correlation between the region of manufacture and a vehicles dependability, will be accepted. Conversely, If the r-value is below 0.7 the null hypothesis will fail to be rejected and it will be concluded that the means of dependability are not statistically correlated across manufacturing regions.

The study will require the following data:
-	Customer satisfaction data pertaining to the dependability of automotive brands.
-	MechaCar’s Prototype data collection including Failure Mode Effect Analysis.
-	Manufacture locations for all competitor vehicles.
-	MechaCar manufacture location. 
-	Manufacture cost for all competitor vehicles.
-	MechaCar projected manufacture cost.
